              Shri Ram's temple will be ready in Ayodhya on 22 January 2024 and everyone will be able to go there to have darshan of God. There has been a dispute on this issue in Ram temple for 500 years. This dispute of Ram Mandir continued for 500 years and why was it not resolved even after so many years of Independence and how Ram Mandir became a political agenda. This whole dispute started in the year 1528 when Babar's army general Mir Baqi demolished the ancient Ram temple situated in Ayodhya and built a mosque which later came to be known as Babri Masjid. The bricks and pillars of the temple were broken. According to some Hindu texts, it was reused in the construction of the mosque itself. The ancient Ram temple which was demolished by Mir Baqi was built by a Hindu king Vikram Aditya. After the year 1528, this entire place became disputed. Babar wrote his autobiography. Whose name was Babar Nama in 1598, where he has mentioned this incident of demolishing the temple and building a mosque. Apart from this, this thing is also mentioned in many European texts. Some records also believe that the mosque was built by Aurangzeb and not Babar. Many historians have given different explanations regarding this confusion between Aurangzeb and Babar. Well, for a long time, Hindus have been demanding their rights at this place, due to which there is a lot of discord between the Hindu and Muslim communities. Disputes have also been going on and out of this, there is mention of one dispute which aroused great anger among the Dono community in the year 1855, after which a small part of this place was taken away by the Hindu community. Later, there was a lot of change in the political structure of entire India. Major change takes place. We are talking about the First Independence War in the year 1856-57, the result of which was that along with Chhas and Gwalior, Ayodhya city also came under the rule of the British East India Company, after which the Ayodhya dispute was settled. Seeing the possibility of Cumulus in the future, the British try to resolve the dispute of Ram Janmabhoomi and they find a solution in such a way that people of both the communities can practice their religious rituals in the disputed area of Ayodhya.

                In 1885, this dispute of Ram Janmabhoomi goes to the court and it is started by Mahant Raghuvir Das. Mahant Raghuvir Das ji files the first suit in Faizabad District Magistrate and the second suit in Faizabad District Court. He demands permission to build the temple in front of Ram Chabutra. But their appeal was rejected at both the places, the result of which was that the Hindu community used to worship the idol of Lord Ram under the Ram platform located outside the mosque till independence.
